# The Object of Hermeneutics - Meaning

Hermeneutic Theory

- Meaning is the greatest focus of hermeneutics
  - What is meaning?
  - Where to find the meaning of a text?
  - Is it possible to obtain one meaning or several?
- This last question comes from the advent of post-modern thought and criticism to rationalism.
- We need to set a hermeneutic theory in order to establish the meaning of a text.

Hans-Georg Gadamer
- Truth and Method (his book)
- his main theses is that the meaning cannot be found in the intension of the author, because the way the interpreter
  goes to a text is conditioned by his own historical moment.
- This leads to the idea that the interpretation is subjective, there can be multiple meaning.
- This is the `reader response` theory.
- This produced the `contextual hermeneutics`, such as feminists, black, homoaffective.
