# Hermeneutics Class 2

## What is Hermeneutics?

- Comes from the Greek *hermeneuo*, which came to mean "translate", or "explain".
- This verb is in the N.T. in a few passages:
  - Luke 24:27
  - John 1:42
- The main idea is to "make a message understandable"
- It is the science of Biblical interpretation. Investigates the meaning of the Biblical text to apply to the current men.
- It is a discipline of Theology, based on the idea that the Bible has to be interpreted.

## Why is it important?

- It is essential to the correct understanding of the Biblical teaching
- It's the step beyond observation.
- It's important for the correct application of the Bible.
- Because the Bible is a book hard to understand, in terms of historical, linguistical, and cultural distances.
- Theology starts and depends on hermeneutics.

## Differences from other disciplines

- Exegesis is the verification of the Biblical meaning in its historical and literary context.
- Exposition is the transmission of the Biblical text to the modern men through preaching or teaching.
- Homiletica is a specific model of Biblical exposition, that is, preaching. Preaching is from the pulpit, teaching
  from the classroom.
- Exposition depends on exegesis.

Hermeneutics + Exegesis + Homiletica = Exposition
