# Introduction to Hermeneutics

- The teacher enphasized that the first thing we need is prayer:

> Without prayer before the text you can study as much as you want.
> The dependency that we must have on the Holy Spirit has to be absolute so that we can understand anything.

- Observe
- Interpret
- Apply

1) Observe:
  meticulous and complete of the text. The more you read, the easier it becomes.

2) Interpretation:
  discern the meaning based on the observations. Seek the meaning intended by the original authors.

3) Apply
  Do what you studied. Main purpose of studying. Without application, the study was vain.

- Choose a book
- Have an understanding of the book as a whole
- Choose a paragraph: because it is an unit of thought
- Study the paragraph

1) Identify where the paragraph starts and where it ends.
2) Read the paragraph many, many, many times.
3) Analyze what's before and after the paragraph.

## Observation

Example in Marc 4:35-41.

a) What comes before?
b) What comes after?

4) Study the paragraph
  General observations. Sometimes the key to understand well a text is in small details.

a) People and their characteristics
  - Disciples
  - crowds
  - The Lord Jesus

b) Places and their characteristics
  - Sea of Galilee

c) Concepts/expressions and their characteristics

d) Events and things that happen

e) Dates, times, and durations

5) Analyze some key words from the paragraph and choose the main word.

Read Genesis 50:15-21
  - 1) identify beginning and end
  - 2) Read many times
  - 3) analyze before and after
  - 4) Many observations
  - 5) Find the key word

6) Interpret the Bible comparing the Bible with the Bible
  - If there is a passage that's difficult to understand, look for references in the Bible itself.

Seek to understand all the words. Use a dictionary. Go into Hebrew and Greek as well.

## The meaning of words and expressions

1) Make a guess based on the **content**
   Check other Bible versions
2) Examine the context
3) Compare the term or key word with other occurrences in the Bible.
4) Research on other books
5) Write your conclusion

But be aware of mistakes. All content outside the Bible was not divinely inspired.

> Genesis exercise
> The word is "intentou"

### Dividing the Text

1) What is the author talking about?
2) What does the author say about the topic his talking about?

- Subject = main topic
- Verb + complement = the main topic

## Application

1) What is the purpose of the order/teaching?
2) To whom was the command/teaching? To us (church)?
3) Do the Epistles continue this command/teaching?
4) How to transport the text to us today?
  - No doubt about the power of God - About the text studied in Mark
  - Don't dispair when things are hard - Same

> Apply the text to you (I, me).
> Be specific.
> Measure if you are really applying.
