# Axioms and consequences of the Bible being a book for humans

5) Each literary style must be understood in accordance with that style.

6) The Bible must be read in accordance with the basic principles of logic and communication.

# The Bible as a Divine Book

If someone reads the Bible as merely a human book they will become what's called a `liberal`. This is a person that
does not consider the supernatural aspect, and does not consider the absolute authority and truth of it.
They say that they just want to understand what the human writers wanted to say without having to draw theological
conclusions.

But we believe that the Bible is a book of Divine origin.

- Because it is a divine book, the Bible is `revelation`
- From this we have the following corolaries:
  - The human writers were directed by God (2 Pt 1:19-21)
    - This means that the human writer wrote in his own style, culture, literary, etc., but what he wrote is what
      God wanted to be written. The style is human, but the message is from God.
    - This is a miracle.
  - Although the authors were falible humans, the result of their works is the infalible Word of God.
  - There is a unity of mind in the diversity of the minds of the authors. That's why the Bible is one book.
  - It is the rule of faith and practice for Christians, which is what makes it necessary to have a correct interpretation
  - The Bible affirms its own supernatural aspect. It goes beyond human reality/dimension.

The fact that the Bible is a book of divine and human origins means it's a book that

COMMUNICATES REVELATION
