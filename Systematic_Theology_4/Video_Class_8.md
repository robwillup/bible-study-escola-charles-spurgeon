# Humilation of Christ

- What did Christ take on?
  - form of servant, likeness of man.
  - The emptying of Himself was the taking on of humanity. He was limited by the human nature.
  - The Lord Jesus took on human limitations and acted through the power of the Holy Spirit.

The Lord Jesus did not abandon His divinity, but His liberty to act independently when He took on human form.
All miracles were done in the power of the Holy Spirit, in accordance with the will of the Father.

Now the Lord has already left this limitation through His exaltation.

## 2 Death

- Jesus became vulnerable to death
- He wasn't only vulnerable though. He actually died. (And rose again!)
- His death was humiliating
  - The worst kind of death from the Roman empire
  - He was mocked about all He claimed to be
    - As prophet - Mt 26:68
    - As king - Lc 23:37
    - As priest - Lc 23:35
- The cross was against all that Christ had said about Himself. How could the Messiah die?

## 3. The descent to Hades

- Some traditions say that between death and resurrection He descended in Hades.
- Texts used are Ep 4:8-10, 1 Pt 3:18, 19, and a declaration in the apostolic creed.
- What say about this?
  - The oldes forms of the creed do not bring this affirmation. It shows up for the first time around 390 d.C.
