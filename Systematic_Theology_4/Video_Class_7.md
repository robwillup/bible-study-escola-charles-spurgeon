# Video Class 7 - The Work of Christ

The stages of the Work of Christ.

- Traditionally, the work of Christ is understood as having two stages: humiliation and exaltation.

## Humiliation

1. Incarnation
  - Incarnation is clear in the New Testament: John 1:14
  - Many times the enphasis is both what the Son left and what He took.
    - He left His glorious position as God. He emptied Himself.
    - Gl 4:4 says He took on flesh and became man.

What Christ left was immense:
- The immediate presence of the Father and of the Holy Spirit
- The continuous praise of the angels
- We can't fathom the splendor of heave, for we've never been there. But nothing on this world can be compared to it.
  Heaven will unite with earth, the new earth and take it over.

Even if Christ had incarnated as the most powerful king, that would still be total humiliation.
But He incarnated as a sevant in a common family. In a small and unknown city. In a manger. He created the law but came under it.

**What about Christ's divine attributes during His humiliation?**

- To say that Christ abandoned his divine attributes is heresy.
- Some say that Christ abandoned part of his attributes, the ones that would compromise his humiliation. Heresy.

God is self-exising, His attributes are essential, they cannot be abandoned. He is immutable.

The 3rd position is that Christ abandoned the **independent use** of His attributes. That is a voluntary
decision that does not change the fact that He's still God.
All miracles had to be done by the will and power of God, through the Holy Spirit. Jesus only used His attributes in
connection with the will of the Father.
This position is defended by Augustus Strong.

There is another interpretantion that says that Christ abandoned the **use** of His attributes.
The different is that in the previous one He left the autonomous use, here just the use.

Another one is that it was an abandonment of the doing of His attributes.

Philipians 2:5-8.

Emptied in Greek means to let go, to abandon. It includes a "assumir" and "se tornar".

The emptying of Christ of His taking on humanity. This is to take on limitations.
