# Preceding aspects of salvation

- Predestination causes a lot of debates
- Predestination is not pre-ordenation which was God's decision related to the order of all events of history.
- It's not election. Elections is God's gracious will to lead some to salvation.

- Calvinism
  - Total depravation
  - God's sovereingty

3. Election

- For Calvinism it's the decision God makes to choose certain people to receive His favor
- It's inconditional
- Based on God's sovereignty
- Election is eficaz. Those who are called will persevere to the end.
- Election is eternal.

- Men lost free will, not freedom. They are free to go to God, but they are incapable because of corrupted nature.

- Variations:
  - Some predestined for salvation, and others predestined for damnation
  - Some for salvation, the others are free to make their choice
