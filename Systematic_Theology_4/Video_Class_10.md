# The work of Christ Part 3 - The Atonement

- Atone is central in Scriptures. God wanted to redeem a people for Himself. Atonement is the provision for redemption.


## The Atonement Theories

### Sociniana - atonement was an example

- Formulated by Faustus and Laulius Socinius in the XVI century.
- Used by the unitarians.
- Pelagianismo. Believes that men can do God's will.
- Believes that people need to be motivated. 
- Does not really preach the Gospel.

It rightly states that Jesus was a great example. But He is far more than that.

But this theory is wrong in many ways, like ignoring the substitution.

### Moral Influence Theory

- Developed by Pedro Abelardo.
- The atonement was not to God to satisfy him, but to men.

- Gets right that God loves us.
- Shows that we need to abandon sin.

- The problem is that it ignores that sin is what offended God,
  we're not just way from Him.

### Governmental Theory - Atonement was the demonstration of God's justice

- Developed by Hugo Grotius
- Enphasizes the seriousness of sin.
- Says that atonement was the demonstration of the divine justice to convince men to abandon sin.
- Christ's death displayed the hatred of God towards sin.
- There wasn't a punishment on the cross for punishment cannot be transfered.
- So Christ did not die for our sins, but for us.

The problems is that it denies that God imputed our sins on Christ.
Shows God as injust.
Sin is no longer horrible if it's just anisty.
Assumes that men can turn to God on their own.

### Rescue Theory - atonement as a victory over sin and evil

- Dominating until 1100 A.D.

### Commercial satisfaction theory
