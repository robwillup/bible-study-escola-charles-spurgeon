## The Work of Christ

* Um ofício é uma função que Crist assumiu em determinado tempo. Não é algo inerente à sua divindade.
* Estes ofícios refletem a comissão que Cristo recebeu como Messias. Jesus foi ungido, mas ungido para algumas funções.
* Históricamente tem-se ensinado que as funções de Jesus como o Cristo foram profeta, sacerdote e rei. Elas estão
  interligadas, e nenhuma dever ser valorizada em detrimento dds outras.

## The Prophetic Office of Christ

* Jesus clearly recognized Himself as a prophet in Mt 13:57
* Others saw Jesus as a prophet in Mt 21:11,46; Lc 24:19
* There was an expectation for The Prophet: John 6:14
* Jesus beign a prophet fulfills prophecies At 3:22, Dt 18:15

### Differences between Jesus and the other prophets

* Jesus is a prophet who came from the presence of God, and that's why He could reveal the Father much better.

### Smilarities

* Jesus' message was like the prophets' messages, judgement and good news.

  * The Holy Spirit's ministry is connected to the ministry of Christ. (John 16:11-13)
  * Luke shows in acts that the ministry of the apostles continues the ministry of Christ.
* In the future
  * The last and most complete revealing work of Jesus is yet to come, Revelation
